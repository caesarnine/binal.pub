I am a data scientist and machine learning engineer with a focus on healthcare. I currently work at Saiva Healthcare, using applied data science to help improve patient lives and workflows in the post acute care setting. My prior roles include applied healthcare ML in the acute care setting at [Vituity](https://vituity.com), leading a data engineering team at [Citadel](https://www.citadel.com/), building out the technology behind the healthcare AI startup [Jvion](https://jvion.com/), and founding the data science practice at [Bandwidth.com](https://www.bandwidth.com/).

I'm passionate about healthcare and healthcare issues - technology by itself won't solve the major issues of healthcare, but I do believe it can help move things in the right direction and reduce needless suffering and burden for patients.

I earned a Masters of Statistics from North Carolina State University in 2018 - earning the degree while working fulltime. I earned a B.S. in Economics from North Carolina State University in 2013.
